# Own-Your-Words-Anti-Subscription-Anti-AI


OwnYourWords with No-Subscription is an offline, subscription-free alternative to Microsoft Word built in Python.

It’s designed for people who want a writing experience without cloud accounts, subscriptions, or distractions. Everything stays local. Your files are yours.

No subscriptions.  
No cloud sync.  
No accounts.  
Just writing.

## Features
- Word-style formatting (bold, italic, underline)
- Text color, alignment, bullets, and indentation
- Comments panel
- Page breaks and PDF export
- Local files only — your writing stays yours

## Why YourOwnWords?
Modern writing tools increasingly require subscriptions, logins, and constant connectivity.
YourOwnWords is an experiment in calm, local-first software.

There are no automatic grammar scans, no content analysis, and no permission-less use of your writing for training datasets. What you write stays local.

Your files live on your desktop and are not designed for simultaneous multi-user editing. This is intentional. This app is built for focused, individual writing rather than collaboration.

If you plan to use OwnYourWords for college or academic work, be sure to coordinate with your school’s policies regarding approved software and submission requirements. The final output would be in PDF only.
